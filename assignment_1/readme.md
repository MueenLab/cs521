# Assignment 1: Dimensionality Reduction

## Objectives

By completing this assignment, you will:

- Understand and implement some commonly used dimensionality reduction techniques
- Design and justify appropriate evaluation metrics.
- Analyze and interpret the impact of dimensionality reduction on a given dataset.
- Learn to use AI tools responsibly in your coding and reporting process.
---

## Task Overview

1. **Implementation:**

   - A high dimensional dataset will be provided. We would like to apply different reduction methods, such as:
     - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
     - Wavelet Transform using Haar matrix
   - Implement each technique using Python (no 3rd party libraries are allowed).
   - Compare the dimensionality reduction techniques. You should choose or design evaluation metrics to support your observation (e.g., distance preservation, execution time, etc.).
   - You can use AI tools to assist with coding (e.g., explaining, commenting debugging), but you must write the core logic yourself.

2. **Two flavors:**
  
    - **Flavor 1:** In this version, you will be given a faulty implementation, as well as a chat history with
      AI tools that generated the code. Your task is to analyze the code, identify and fix the issues, and complete the analysis.
    - **Flavor 2:** In this version, you will get a template Jupyter Notebook with the predefined structure and some 
      starter code. Your task is to fill in the missing parts, implement the techniques, and complete the analysis.
    - You can choose either flavor based on your preference.
    - **Note:** The two flavors are designed to be equivalent in terms of learning outcomes, so choose the one you find more engaging.
3. **Report:**

   Write a report yourself (AI NOT allowed here) that includes:
   - An introduction to each technique and implementation summary
   - Justification of your evaluation metrics
   - Results, discussion of tradeoffs, and key insights
   - AI usage reflection
   
4. **AI Usage Reflection:**
   
   Briefly describe your thought on how you used AI tools. What worked well? What didn't? How did it help you learn or improve your work? 
   Please also append your chat history with AI tools at the end of your report.

## AI Usage Policy

**AI tools are allowed, but only if used responsibly:**

| Allowed                          | Not Allowed                                 |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Debugging help,                  | Copy-pasting entire solutions               |
| Summarizing, commenting          | Using AI to generate full report or metrics |
| Improving report clarity/grammar | Submitting unedited AI output as your work  |
