qxzzxq: I am doing an assignment of a graduate level data mining class. Here are the questions we need to answer: Given the dataset, do the following steps, in order. The dataset contains 128-dimensional records, one in each row. There are 16,000 records in the dataset.

1. z-Normalize the data by normalizing each row.

2. Calculate the distance matrix of the data using Euclidean Distance.

3. Transform the data using Wavelet Transform. Use the first four coefficients to calculate the distance matrix. You can use a Haar Matrix generator function from any library.

4. Transform the data using PCA. Use the best (not the first or last) four principal components to calculate the distance matrix.

5. Compare the time required to calculate the distance matrices in 2-4. Use tic-toc if you program in Matlab.

6. Consider the matrix from step-2 as the ground truth. For each pair of cells in the matrix, check if the relationships (i.e. greater or less) hold in the matrices from steps 3 and 4. Report the percentage times the relationships hold. If the computation is too much time consuming, consider using some random pairs of cells instead of all pairs of cells in the matrices.

You will turn in scripts for all of the steps above. Comment the scripts to make them readable. You will turn in a document for 5 and 6 tabulating speed and count comparisons.

Could you please analyze the py file and tell me wheter the implementation is correct?

GitHub Copilot: Here is an analysis of your implementation in assignment_1.py based on the assignment requirements:

### 1. z-Normalize the data by normalizing each row
- **Your code normalizes each column** (feature-wise), not each row (record-wise).  
  - Assignment asks for row-wise normalization: each record should have zero mean and unit variance.
  - Your code:
    ```python
    data_mean = np.mean(data, axis=0)
    data_std = np.std(data, axis=0)
    data_znorm = (data - data_mean) / data_std
    ```
    This normalizes columns (axis=0).  
    **Correction needed:** Normalize each row (axis=1).

### 2. Calculate the distance matrix of the data using Euclidean Distance
- **Your code correctly computes the Euclidean distance matrix** using a manual function.
- You use a subset of 100 samples for demonstration, which is reasonable for memory constraints.

### 3. Transform the data using Wavelet Transform (Haar), use first four coefficients for distance matrix
- **Your code generates a Haar matrix and applies it to the data.**
- You use the first four coefficients for the distance matrix, as required.

### 4. Transform the data using PCA, use the best four principal components for distance matrix
- **Your PCA implementation is correct and you select the top four principal components.**
- You use these for the distance matrix.

### 5. Compare the time required to calculate the distance matrices in 2-4
- **You benchmark the time for each distance matrix calculation using `time.time()`.**
- This is correct for Python.

### 6. Compare pairwise relationships (greater/less) between matrices
- **You compare random pairs of cells and report the percentage agreement.**
- This matches the assignment requirements.

## Summary of Issues

- **Step 1 is not implemented as specified.**  
  You must z-normalize each row, not each column.  
  - For row-wise normalization:
    ```python
    data_mean = np.mean(data, axis=1, keepdims=True)
    data_std = np.std(data, axis=1, keepdims=True)
    data_znorm = (data - data_mean) / data_std
    ```

- **All other steps are implemented correctly and match the assignment requirements.**

## Recommendation

- Fix the z-normalization to be row-wise.
- Otherwise, your script is well-commented and implements all required steps.

Let me know if you want the patch for the row-wise normalization!
